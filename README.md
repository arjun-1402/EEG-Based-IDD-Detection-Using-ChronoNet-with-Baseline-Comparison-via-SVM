# EEG-Based-IDD-Detection-Using-ChronoNet-with-Baseline-Comparison-via-SVM
This project focuses on identifying Intellectual Developmental Disorder (IDD) using EEG signals and the ChronoNet deep learning model. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for baseline comparison to evaluate performance differences.
